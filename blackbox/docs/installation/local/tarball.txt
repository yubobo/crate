===================
Install Via Tarball
===================

.. highlight:: sh

After downloading the latest stable version of CrateDB from
`crate.io/download/ <https://crate.io/download/>`_
the package needs to be unpacked::

   sh$ tar zxf crate-*.tar.gz
   sh$ cd crate-*

Once unpacked CrateDB can be started in the foreground like this::

   sh$ ./bin/crate

In order to start in the background add the ``-d`` option. If started in the
foreground you can use ``Control-C`` to stop the process again.


The CrateDB Shell (Crash) is shipped with the tarball distribution.
You can start the shell using the ``crash`` command::

  sh$ ./bin/crash

The CrateDB distribution also comes with a web based administration
interface. It is served on port ``4200`` and you can access it with
your browser once CrateDB is started::

  http://host1.example.com:4200/

.. note::

   The admin interface runs on each node where CrateDB is installed.

.. note::

   If the previous URL is accessed via libraries (eg. cURL), or via offline
   browsers (eg. wget) the request will be handled by the CrateDB Rest API,
   and the response will be JSON.
